        <p>One of the important factors when considering a master's degree is the cost of 
            study. Luckily, there are many options available to help students fund their
             master's programme. For students with an interest in sport, there’s a sports 
             complex, which includes playing fields and courts. There are also plenty of 
             clubs to join as well as annual competitions where students can represent the university.</p>
